## Our Initial Response to eBay (submitted)
"Item 376396781361 sold as new, sealed in protective plastic film on the body of the car to protect the paint provided by the manufacturer. Listing & attached photos show intact front left tire, rear suspension, accessories including the clear plastic top, pink cloth in foam pkg, & all parts. Buyer claimed tire/suspension damage; returned item missing clear plastic top, pink cloth, film, & possibly swapped. Altered/damaged by buyer; deny refund per eBay policy. Evidence: original vs. return photos."

## eBay's Rationale for Ruling in Buyer's Favor
- **Case #:** 5374256784
- **Seller account:** Linda Zurawski (scottm48), scott@unclesvf.com
- **Case opened:** Feb 17, 2026
- **Case closed:** Feb 18, 2026 (SAME DAY — minimal investigation)
- **Refund:** $250.00 issued to buyer, recovered from seller by eBay
- **eBay rep:** Imtiaz K.
- **eBay's stated reason:** "we couldn't determine that this was caused by the buyer, or that this was something in the buyer's control"
- eBay acknowledged seller's photos but said they're "not in direct position/place to identify how the issue was caused"
- eBay refunded preemptively to prevent buyer from filing chargeback with bank
- eBay suggested: contact buyer, report buyer, carrier claim, or 30-day appeal

## Appeal Strategy — SMOKING GUN EVIDENCE

The appeal must overcome eBay's stated bar: "couldn't determine this was caused by the buyer."

**Five independently verifiable discrepancies that ONLY buyer tampering explains:**

| # | Evidence | As Shipped (listing photos) | As Returned |
|---|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Factory plastic wrap | ON the car body | COMPLETELY GONE |
| 2 | Accessory bag | Sealed pink/red cloth bag in foam compartment | Green-stripe Ziploc sandwich bag (NOT ORIGINAL) |
| 3 | Car placement | Seated in custom molded foam cradle | Loose on tissue paper, not in cradle |
| 4 | Front left wheel | Intact in multiple listing photos | Disassembled into 4 pieces (wheel, spring, pin, bracket) |
| 5 | Broken part loose | No loose parts | Black plastic piece loose on tissue paper in box |

**Key arguments:**
1. The Ziploc bag is a SMOKING GUN — no shipping damage converts a sealed pink cloth bag into a green-stripe Ziploc
2. Factory plastic wrap doesn't remove itself during shipping
3. The disassembled parts (spring, threaded pin, steering bracket) require DELIBERATE MANIPULATION — these are internal mechanical parts protected by wrap + foam
4. Car was not returned in the foam cradle despite foam being present — buyer removed car, handled it, couldn't reseat it properly
5. Case was opened AND closed on the same day — insufficient investigation of photo evidence

## Condition of Returned Item (7 photos, IMG_1686-1693 series)
**The car was returned in SIGNIFICANTLY different condition than shipped:**

1. **Factory plastic wrap REMOVED** — listing photos clearly show wrap on car; return has none
2. **Car NOT in styrofoam cradle** — returned loosely placed on tissue paper in box, not seated in custom foam
3. **Broken part loose in box** — black plastic piece (mirror/antenna?) sitting loose on tissue paper
4. **Accessories repackaged in Ziploc** — original sealed pink/red cloth bag replaced with green-stripe Ziploc sandwich bag containing loose parts
5. **Car has been fully handled/unpacked by buyer** — no longer in "new in box" condition
6. **Undercarriage exposed** — shows "CRAFTED IN CHINA" / "JAMES BOND 007 ASTON MARTIN DB5"

**FULL LIST OF MISSING/ALTERED ITEMS (per Linda, verified):**
- Factory protective plastic film (removed from car body)
- Clear plastic panoramic roof top
- Black trunk mat for the car
- Original sealed pink/red cloth accessory bag (replaced with Ziploc)
- NOTE: spare tire/seat was initially thought missing but WAS present in return

**NO DAMAGE TO SHIPPING BOXES:** Outer box and inner foam box both undamaged on return — rules out shipping damage as cause

**KEY ARGUMENT: Buyer opened, handled, and broke the item, then returned it in worse condition than received. Original factory packaging (plastic wrap, sealed accessory bag) was discarded. Linda/Stan believe buyer SWAPPED his own broken car for the new sealed one — buyer is a toy car seller on eBay.**

**LINDA'S LOGIC (critical for appeal):** If the tire truly fell off when he opened the box, why did he remove the protective plastic film from the car body? A buyer returning a damaged item would leave the film on and put it right back. Removing the film only makes sense if you're keeping the new car.

## Case Details
- **eBay Order #:** 12-14177-48834
- **Sale price:** $250 (buyer offered $225, Scott countered $250, accepted)
- **Buyer username:** mkr_us_fllwswo
- **Buyer name:** Mike Krikorian
- **Listed as:** NEW in Box
- **Item title:** Model James Bond 007 Aston Martin DB5 Replica 1:24 New in Box
- **Sold as estate item** — Wilkins Estate, owner deceased, heirs described/listed the car
- **Original listing description:** "1964 Die Cast Aston Martin DB5 Replica 1:24 scale new in Box. This Silver color car comes with all the important documents as given by the Danbury Mint. This car still has the protective plastic sheets on the car as delivered by the Danbury Mint. All the accessories are still in the original sealed plastic as it came from the Mint. This is being sold by order of the Wilkins Estate. SL6537"

## Buyer's Claims
- Left front tire fell off when he opened the box
- Says car was "glued" and "repaired"
- Claims it's "not a brand new car" and was "obviously displayed"
- Says there's "a plastic piece missing"
- Says "another missing part"
- "You guys misrepresented it"

## Buyer's Evidence Photos (4 photos, "Returned car" series)
1. **Returned car 1** — Close-up of front wheel well showing broken mounting point inside arch
2. **Returned car 2** — Disassembled parts on Danbury Mint paperwork: detached wheel/tire, spring, threaded pin, chrome bracket/steering link
3. **Returned car 3** — Undercarriage held in hand, missing wheel, rear suspension visible
4. **Returned car 4** — Yellow DeWalt spec label (irrelevant background)

## Message Timeline (Chronological)
- **Feb 1** — Buyer offers $225
- **Feb 7, 12:52 PM** — Scott counters $250
- **Feb 7, 1:09 PM** — Buyer accepts $250
- **Feb 7, 1:37 PM** — Buyer: "Include all documents"
- **Feb 7, 2:49 PM** — Buyer: "Tire came off, been glued, not new" + photos
- **Feb 7, 2:51-2:54 PM** — Buyer: "Repaired and glued, misrepresented", "another missing part"
- **Feb 8, 3:49 PM** — Scott: "Estate item, owner deceased, return for full refund"
- **Feb 8, 3:52 PM** — Buyer asks about return logistics/shipping cost
- **Feb 8, 4:23 PM** — Scott provides eBay return links
- **Feb 8, 4:32 PM** — Buyer submits return request with photos
- **Feb 8, 5:22 PM** — Scott: "Will refund promptly when received"
- **Feb 8 (or later)** — Buyer: "Dropping at USPS today"
- **Feb 16** — Buyer: "Dropped off Saturday, want refund ASAP"
- **Feb 17** — Buyer confused: "Why did eBay open a case? You said full refund"

## Key Observations
- Scott agreed to full refund in good faith immediately
- Buyer received the car on Feb 7 and claimed damage same day within ~1 hour of the "looking forward to it" message
- The "damage" shown (spring, axle pin, steering bracket) are internal mechanical parts protected by factory plastic wrap + foam cradle — these don't come apart in shipping
- Buyer's claim of "glued" is unsubstantiated — listing photos show pristine factory condition
- Item returned in significantly worse condition: no plastic wrap, not in foam, parts in Ziploc, broken piece loose
